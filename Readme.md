# Readme

Welcome to my collection of the recipes I have come up with over the years. Most of these recipes are free of refined sugar and are either gluten-free or dairy free, or have the option to be.

I am slowly but surely moving all my recipes over to this, and on top of that I make about a new recipe a month, so keep checking this repo for updates. 

The spices in these recipes are measured for freshly ground spices, which are more potent, so if you are using pre-ground spices, you will probably need to use 25-50% more.

If you'd like to see the recipes in testing right now, feel free to switch to the `Dev` branch and check out the exclusive recipes and updates there.
