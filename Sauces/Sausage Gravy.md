## Directions

1. Cook sausage in a skillet
1. Add flour to skillet stir and cook for 5 minutes, stirring regularly but not constantly, just enough so it doesn't burn on the bottom
1. Pour milk in a cup at a time while mixing, adding another cup only when the mixture has thickened
1. Cook mixture on medium heat until it's thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. It should leave a line if you run your finger through the sauce.
